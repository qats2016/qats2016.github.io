Invited talk by Advaith Siddharthan:<br><br>


<font size="4" color="#6600cc">"Is Automatic Text Simplification Useful?"</font> <br>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I'll provide a personal perspective on evaluating Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) systems, particularly when I have made the leap from asking "Does my ATS system produce better output than something else?" to asking "Is my ATS system useful to anyone?" When asking the first question, I have found evaluations relatively straightforward to perform, with clear results that are easy to interpret and therefore publish. When asking the second question, I have encountered often fiddly methodological issues, and my experiments to date have thrown up a mixed bag of results that I haven't always anticipated. There is now enough data from such experiments that some patterns have begun to emerge. I will discuss some of these and ask what they mean for Quality Assessment  for Text Simplification.
